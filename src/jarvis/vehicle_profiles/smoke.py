"""Fase C · C3 — pytest smoke path only (not Engineer Board smoke).

Python scaffold / sim only — production flight_control runtime is C++
(future IC). `run_hal_imu_smoke` loads a vehicle profile, builds a
`SimulatedImuHal` from it, and reads samples. It MUST NOT call
`SafetyGate.evaluate` for an `allow` outcome (reading a sensor is not
actuation) and MUST NOT touch any actuator — there is none to touch in
this package.
